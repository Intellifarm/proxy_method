# proxy_method

Prevent running an inherited method directly.

The purpose of this gem is to prevent directly running the inherited
methods you choose to block, and instead raise a custom Error message.
The original method can still be called under a different name.

This was created to help enforce the use of interactors over directly
calling ActiveRecord methods like create, save, and update. One downside
of interactors is that they require top-of-mind awareness in order to use
them, and by default new/forgetful/overworked developers will create
ActiveRecord instances all willy nilly until society crumbles.

While this was created for ActiveRecord models specifically, it works
with *any* inherited methods. The method being proxied has to already
exist, or it can't be overridden.

## Usage

Given these basic classes:

    class Animal
      def self.create
        'created'
      end
    
      def save
        'saved'
      end
      
      def update
        'updated'
      end
    end
    
    class Turtle < Animal
      include ProxyMethod
    
      proxy_class_method :create
      proxy_instance_method :save
      
      # for instance methods, you can also just call "proxy_method"
      proxy_method :update
    end

You can do this:

    Turtle.create
    # => RuntimeError: Disabled by proxy_method
    
    Turtle.new.save
    # => RuntimeError: Disabled by proxy_method
    
    Turtle.unproxied_create
    # => 'created'
    
    Turtle.new.unproxied_save
    # => 'saved'

Specify a custom error message:

    class CustomCow < Animal
      include ProxyMethod
      
      proxy_method :save, message: "Don't save here, use an interactor!"
    end
    
    CustomCow.new.save
    # => RunTimeError: Don't save here, use an interactor!

Specify multiple methods at once:

    class MultiMonkey < Animal
      include ProxyMethod
      
      proxy_method [:save, :update], message: "Use an interactor!"
    end
    
    MultiMonkey.new.save
    # => RunTimeError: Use an interactor!
    
    MultiMonkey.new.update
    # => RunTimeError: Use an interactor!    

Supply your own prefix for the original, unproxied method:

    class PrefixPelican < Animal
      include ProxyMethod
      
      proxy_method :save, prefix: 'pelican_'
    end
    
    PrefixPelican.new.pelican_save
    # => 'saved'
