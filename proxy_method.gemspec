  spec.description = <<-TURTLES
    The purpose of this gem is to prevent directly running the inherited
    methods you choose to block, and instead raise a custom Error message.
    The original method can still be called under a different name.

    This was created to help enforce the use of interactors over directly
    calling ActiveRecord methods like create, save, and update.
